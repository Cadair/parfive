aiofiles will be used if installed and must be explicitly enabled
"PARFIVE_OVERWRITE_ENABLE_AIOFILES" environment variable takes
precedence if present. If the value is != "enable" aiofiles will
not be used.

Finally if the "Downloader" receives an argument "use_aiofiles=True"
during instantiation the aiofiles will be used.
